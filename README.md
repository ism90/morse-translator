# Morse Code Translator

Morse Code Translator developed Fri-Monday as a challenge for \_nology course. Objectives included taking a Test Driven Development approach.
The translator detects the input language (Morse Code or English) and translates accordingly. This was achieved with Object Key Value pairs and a constructor class. A third party library to play Morse sound was also added.
